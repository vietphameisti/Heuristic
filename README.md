#Heuristic - Maximization of a Building Surface on a Parcel of Land using the Tabu Search Algorithm

##The problematic

>An architectural firm proposes the following simplified problem: “find the building with
the largest floor area contained in the given parcel”, this can be rewritten in the form of the
optimization problems of maximization: Given any polygon (convex or concave), the goal is to
find the largest rectangle contained in it.

##A Tabu Search approach to solve the problem

<br>Regarding the architectural institution introduced the problem that we attempt to optimize
the maximization of a building’s surface on a parcel of land with heuristic and stochastic
optimization methodologies and algorithms.
<br>The Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm proposed by Fred Glover in
1989 and 1993. It is an iterative method that explores a set of problem solutions, making moves
from one solution x to another solution x0 inside a neighborhood V(x). Moves aim to find optimal
or near-optimal solutions, evaluating some objective function that is to be minimized.
